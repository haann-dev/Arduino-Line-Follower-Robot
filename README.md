# Arduino-Line-Follower-Robot
This Arduino line follower robot uses a 5-channel line tracking sensor TRCT5000L for precise path detection. The OLED display (0.96 inch) indicates the robot's mode â€” manual via IR remote or automatic line-following. The L298N motor driver manages motor speed and direction, while the IR remote control offers flexible manual control.
