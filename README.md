# 🤖 Arduino Line Follower Robot

This Arduino line follower robot uses a **5-channel line tracking sensor TRCT5000L** for precise path detection. The **OLED display (0.96 inch)** shows the robot's mode — either in manual mode via **IR remote control** or automatic line-following mode. The **L298N motor driver** controls the speed and direction of the DC motors, making the robot responsive and efficient.
